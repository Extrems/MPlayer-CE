#summary TODO list for MPlayerCE

= Introduction =

This is our current TODO list.  If you have any other feature requests please add them on the [http://code.google.com/p/mplayer-ce/issues/list Issues] page.  Please do not duplicate requests for items listed here - it will not make them get completed any faster.  They are not listed in any order of priority, and some are much more difficult to implement than others.

== To-do for New GUI ==

* OSD not working
* TakeScreenshot needs to be called when HOME pressed. Needs to render an additional frame to call TakeScreenshot after GX_Done, THEN return to GUI
* Loading a file from a SMB share has a delay. GUI appears to "freeze" rather than showing a progress bar. Need to return control to MPlayer AFTER caching is done (move caching before MPlayer GX init)
* Loading a second file does not work (resumes first file instead)
* Need to mount and list ALL found NTFS/FAT partitions on all devices in the GUI's device menu
* DVD Video playing code needs work. Should jump directly into movie's menu and/or main movie (if there is no menu). Should be using libdvdnav ONLY. 

== Features ==

* Image support
* Audio visualisation
* Play whole directory: choose shuffle/continuous etc
