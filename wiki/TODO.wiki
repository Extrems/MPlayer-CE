#summary TODO list for MPlayerCE

= Introduction =

This is our current TODO list.  If you have any other feature requests please add them on the [http://code.google.com/p/mplayer-ce/issues/list Issues] page.  Please do not duplicate requests for items listed here - it will not make them get completed any faster.  They are not listed in any order of priority, and some are much more difficult to implement than others.
