=USB 2.0=

You need to install the USB 2.0 cIOS from [http://mplayer-ce.googlecode.com/files/hermes_cios_installer.dol here].

If you have installed a previous version of the USB 2.0 cIOS you must use [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/AnyTitle_Deleter/ AnyTitle Deleter] to remove it before installing. (Only if the new installation keeps giving errors, also remove the 0000000 folder it may have created on root of SD)
If you don't have wifi you can use the offline install via [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Talk:CIOS_usb2#Offline_Installation here]

In the installer, choose to install as IOS202 using IOS36.

You must then then install [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/DVDx DVDx] using advanced mode and selecting IOS202.  
Even if you don't plan on playing DVDs this is necessary for MPlayer CE to detect if the cIOS is installed.

Plug in your USB device before loading MPlayer, and it should be mounted.  Some devices do not support hotplugging.

Users with system menu 3.4 or higher will not be able to use USB2.0 with MPlayerCE because the DVDx installer for this system does not have an advanced mode.  Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it.

If you plan on updating make sure to install the cIOS and DVDx before updating.
