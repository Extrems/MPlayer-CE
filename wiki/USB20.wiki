=USB 2.0=

You need to install the USB 2.0 cIOS from [http://code.google.com/p/mplayer-ce/downloads/list here].

(Please note that this requires a internet connection).

The installer is for Homebrew USB2 only, this will install IOS202 using base IOS60 automatically. 
You can select the IOS to use to do the installation, 
so you can select a IOS with the fake sign bug. (IOS60 is downloaded to SD via the Nintendo's Update Server).

We are using IOS60 as a base as there has been improvements in wifi.
Those that install this cIOS do not require a DVDx installation.

Users without the fakesign bug cannot install the cIOS to use USB2.
There is a work around for this but we cannot advise about it.
Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it.

If you plan on updating make sure to install the cIOS and DVDx before updating.
