#summary New GUI

== Introduction ==

Thank you all for your interest in the new GUI. I see lots of interesting thoughts here; however, it is important to limit artwork to the scope of this first release. So, I should provide some specifics about it!

I've taken some screenshots of the GUI as it is now. It's important to note that these are only to show the currently proposed layout and feature set, and are not a reflection on the look or end design - that is still in flux.

This layout is not set in stone, feel free to change it up. However, if you decide to do so, *please don't present any half thought out or totally unrealistic ideas*. It must have practical navigation and a layout that's sensible for the Wii. For example, the Wii doesn't lend itself well to small buttons, small controls, or small fonts - everything must be somewhat "oversized". Also, you need to respect the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_area safe area] and work within a 640x480 target resolution.

There will be a menu bar (at the top or bottom) that will go into the different areas (Videos, Pictures, Music, DVD, Online Media). Each area will have a somewhat different layout to reflect the different content type. The app will jump into the Videos area on startup, to the last browsed folder.


==New features that will be in the first release:==

  * Wiimote pointing support
  * Online update
  * Image support
  * XML-based settings
  * Settings menu, where *all* settings can be configured
  * Onscreen-keyboard
  * Picture viewer
  * In-video progress bar (play/pause/skip/seek etc)
  * Music player, with playlist support
  * Shuffle/continuous play, enqueue a file or folder
  * File browser memory. Remembers what Video/Music folder you were last in

==Features that will NOT be in the first release (and possibly not in subsequent releases either):==

  * Audio visualizations
  * Searching
  * Translations
  * Thumbnails, previews, descriptions, box art, etc
  * Skinning
  * Controller mapping

Please limit your designs to the GUI as I have described it above. Keep in mind what features will not be implemented for this release. Also note that possibly only one artist will be asked to do the layout, but that all other submissions will be considered by the team for the final design. Oh, and don't be afraid to use color - it doesn't *have* to be monochrome!

Note that this does not show file/folder enqueuing - that has yet to be determined
