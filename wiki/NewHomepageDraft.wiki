*23.04.2009. Codedump warning*

If you are experiencing code dumps and have the USB 2.0 cIOS installed it may be because of a known bug.
If you have the USB 2.0 cIOS installed and your Wii is configured to connect to your network, you will experience a codedump if your router is off and the Wii cannot connect.
If this is a likely scenario then you must either
 * leave your router on
 * do not install the USB 2.0 cIOS.
 * move your DVDx install back to the default position
We are working to fix this issue.

Mplayer-CE is a homebrew media player for the Nintendo Wii. It was initially created as a fork of the Team Twiizers MPlayer port, combining elements of MPlayerWii, GeeXboX and other great homebrew contributions. It is built with devkitPro development tools, fully homebrew driven and not associated with Nintendo in any way.

Some of the current features includes DVD, SDHC, USB 2.0 storage device support, multiple media, subtitle, playlist and streaming formats, customization possibilities, etc.

We hope you like it ;) Mplayer-CE Team.
