*23.04.2009. Codedump warning*

If you are experiencing code dumps and have the USB 2.0 cIOS installed it may be because of a known bug.
If you have the USB 2.0 cIOS installed and your Wii is configured to connect to your network, you will experience a codedump if your router is off and the Wii cannot connect.
If this is a likely scenario then you must either
 * leave your router on
 * do not install the USB 2.0 cIOS.
 * move your DVDx install back to the default position
We are working to fix this issue.
