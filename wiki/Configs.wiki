*Setup and Edit your Configs.*

*smb.conf*
Open up your smb.conf, it has 5 shares.
Determine how many shares you want to use. and fill in the fields.
E.g. I have a folder "network shared" on C:\ called Movies, I don't have a password on my user account, and my folder isn't protected. Therefore I don't need to add my user in the field in the example below.

#Samba share1  (smb1:/)

ip1=*192.168.0.1*

share1*=Movies*

user1=

pass1=

I now have a folder on D:\ but my "network shared" folder has a space and it's named My Music.
Fill it out like this with the " " besides the share location.

#Samba share1  (smb1:/)

ip2=*192.168.0.1*

share2=*"My Music"*

user2=

pass2=

If you have a password on your user account, simply fill all fields in.



*menu.conf*
You can change the layout of your menu.conf
Doing so will change the main menu's layout in MPlayerCE

Open up your menu.conf, and compare to my example below.
<cmdlist name="main" title="MPlayer UE" ptr="<>" >
      <e name="Stop" ok="loadfile loop.avi"/>
      <e name="Browse ..." ok="set_menu browse" />
      <e name="DVD ..." ok="set_menu dvd"/>
      <e name="Radio ..." ok="set_menu radio"/>
      <e name="SMB1 share ..." ok="set_menu open_smb1"/>
      <e name="SMB2 share ..." ok="set_menu open_smb2"/>
      <e name="SMB3 share ..." ok="set_menu open_smb3"/>
      <e name="Options ..." ok="set_menu pref_main"/>
      <e name="Aspect ..." ok="set_menu aspect"/>
      <e name="About" ok="set_menu about"/>
      <e name="Quit" ok="quit"/>

Also you can change the following, e.g. remove the Radio/About/Aspect path and head it under Options in menu.conf etc. Change it to suit you. As you can see iv'e removed "share" as this no longer works as we now have 5 shares.
*Remember* you can add Radio streams, look under Radio in menu.conf and use the same function as the other3 in their.


*mplayer.conf*
This is where you can add a line so MPlayerCE autoboots into a specific video mode, e.g. 2:35Open up your mplayer.conf and compare to my example.

vo=gekko

ao=gekko

framedrop=yes

alang=en

really-quiet=yes

menu=yes

menu-startup=yes

cache=8192

cache-min=4

loop=0

*aspect=1.7777*

bgvideo=sd:/apps/mplayer_ce/loop.avi

As you can see i have added the line *aspect=1.7777* therefore this autoboot MPlayerCE to 16/9 setting, therefore everything is in 16/9 and the loop.avi is fullscreen.
Change to suit you.


*Customising*
You can use your own *loop.avi*
Just replace the current one with your own
The best dimensions are 640x456
You can also have a music in the loop.avi
My loop.avi is 1 minute long and has no issues. and is 3.5mb in size.
Virtualdub is the best program to create your loop.avi, you can use a still image and add audio. make sure you compress the video with XVID MPEG4 CODEC, in compression.
