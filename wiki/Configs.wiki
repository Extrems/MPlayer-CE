*Setup smb.conf*
MPlayer_CE v0.2 now supports 5 SMB shares, this is how your smb.conf should look.

#Max 5 samba shares (review menu.conf to add more samba browsing)
#no ip or no share means samba disabled

#Samba share1  (smb1:/)
ip1=192.168.0.1
share1=films
user1=
pass1=

#Samba share2  (smb2:/)
ip2=
share2=
user2=
pass2=

#Samba share3  (smb3:/)
ip3=
share3=
user3=
pass3=

#Samba share4  (smb4:/)
ip4=
share4=
user4=
pass4=

#Samba share3  (smb5:/)
ip5=
share5=
user5=
pass5=

If you have a user account you can fill it in, even if you have one you don't need to unless your smb shares are protected...

e.g.
#Samba share1  (smb1:/)
ip1=192.168.0.1
share1=films
user1=
pass1=

This share will locate your SMB share "folder" without a password/user account filled in.
Only works like this, if your user account doesn't have folders protected, this is the same for using a Guest account no password/user.
If you have a password on your user account, it should look like this:

#Samba share1  (smb1:/)
ip1=192.168.0.1
share1=films
user1=UserAccount
pass1=password

As always make sure your folders are "network shared."
