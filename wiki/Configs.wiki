*Setup and Edit your Configs.*

*smb.conf*
Open up your smb.conf, it has 5 shares.
Determine how many shares you want to use. and fill in the fields.
E.g. I have a folder "network shared" on C:\ called Movies, I don't have a password on my user account, and my folder isn't protected. Therefore I don't need to add my user in the field in the example below.

#Samba share1  (smb1:/)
ip1=192.168.0.1
share1=Movies
user1=
pass1=

I now have a folder on D:\ but my "network shared" folder has a space and it's named My Music.
Fill it out like this with the " " besides the share location.
#Samba share1  (smb1:/)
ip2=192.168.0.1
share2="My Music"
user2=
pass2=
