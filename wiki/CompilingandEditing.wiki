#summary Compiling and Editing

= Introduction =

This page will tell you how to compile the source, and where to make changes.

==Compiling==
 * Compile modified libogc ('make wii' and 'make install') then compile libfat ('make ogc-install'), they are on libs directory on svn.

 * In order to compile mplayer_ce you first need to build libdvdread and libdvdnav.

 * In config.mak in both libdvdread and libdvdnav you need to set both SRC_PATH and SRC_PATH_BARE to the correct directory, eg /c/projects/mplayer_ce-source/libdvdread-trunk (remember that it is case sensitive).

 * After this you can build livdvdread with 'make' and 'make install' and then libdvdnav with 'make' and 'make install' (in that order).

 * Now you can build mplayer_ce with 'make'.

 * It should create mplayer.dol in the mplayer-trunk directory.

==Editing the source==
The files you will want to look at specific to the wii port are
{{{
/osdep/plat_gekko.h
/osdep/plat_gekko.c
/osdep/getch2-gekko.c
/osdep/gx_supp.c
/osdep/gx_supp.h

Several other files are also modified but not to a great extent.
